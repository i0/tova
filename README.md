# Flexible Test of Attention Variables (Flexible TOVA)
Flexible Test of Attention Variables (Flexible TOVA) is a software for the measurement of executive functions.

Flexible TOVA is a continuous performance test (CPT) which its test variables could be easily manipulated by the test administrator. For example, in flexible TOVA we can easily increase or decrease the following parameters before starting a test for a particular child:
- Time on task (by manipulating the number of stimuli to be presented in a test session) 
- inter-stimulus interval (ISI)
- display time (DT) 

### Tech

TOVA uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [VueJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Laravel] - The expressive and elegant PHP framework
* [Semantic UI] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps

### Installation

TOVA requires [PHP](https://php.net/) v7+ to run.

Install the dependencies.

```sh
$ cd tova
$ composer install
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ php artisan serve
```
